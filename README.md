# GeneticMan.rs
Genetic algorithms are better than fleshy meatbags

# Getting started

Rust (specifically Cargo) doesn't like dots in filenames, so the following command will clone the repo into a folder called `GeneticMan`.

	git clone git@github.com:jamwaffles/GeneticMan.rs.git GeneticMan

To compile and run the project run:

	cargo run

To just build the project run:

	cargo build
